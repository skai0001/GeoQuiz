# GeoQuiz
A practice Android application from the textbook "Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide (3rd Edition)".<br/>
This is the first app in the book. It covers initial basic concepts of Android programming.
The app has a small database of True/False geography questions. 
Users can loop through the questions and get true/false answers. 
Users also have the option to cheat to find the answer. However, their cheating history is provisioned, and they are judged for it!
